## Developers
If you are wishing to add or remove mods and other assets to the pack, we use [Pakku](https://juraj-hrivnak.github.io/Pakku/home.html). If you wish to learn more about it read the docs. To download and setup the dependancies do the following:

2) `git clone https://github.com/Squawkykaka/RobarealmS4.git minecraft` to copy the code
3) Open up the new minecraft folder in your preferred editor
